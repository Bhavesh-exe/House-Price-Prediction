# 🧬 Malignant Cancer Detection

This project uses a machine learning model to detect malignant tumors based on various input features from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. It predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant using a trained classification model and a Gradio-based interface.


## 🧠 Features Used
- Mean Radius  
- Mean Texture  
- Mean Perimeter  
- Mean Area  
- Mean Smoothness  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Gradio (for frontend interface)
